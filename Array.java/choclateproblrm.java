//Q.Given an array arr[] of n integers where arr[i] represents the number of chocolates in ith packet. Each packet can have a variable number of chocolates. There are m students, the task is to distribute chocolate packets such that: 

//Each student gets exactly one packet.
//The difference between the maximum and minimum number of chocolates in the packets given to the students is minimized.

//Input: arr[] = {7, 3, 2, 4, 9, 12, 56}, m = 3 
//Output: 2 
//Explanation: If we distribute chocolate packets {3, 2, 4}, we will get the minimum difference, that is 2. 

////Input: arr[] = {7, 3, 2, 4, 9, 12, 56}, m = 5 
//Output: 7
//Explanation: If we distribute chocolate packets {3, 2, 4, 9, 7}, we will get the minimum difference, that is 9 - 2 = 7.
